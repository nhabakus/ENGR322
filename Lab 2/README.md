In this lab we go over some basic command line prompts. Some of them I was already familiar with, but most were new lines which I learned their purpose.
```
hostname           // shows the name of your computer (host name)

env                // displays all environment variables

ps                 // shows currently running processes

pwd                // prints the current working directory

git clone https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot.git    // downloads the iot project from the GitHub linked

cd iot            // moves into the 'iot' directory

ls                // lists all files and folders in the current directory

cd                // moves back to your home directory

df                // shows how much disk space is used and available

mkdir demo        // creates a new directory called demo

cd demo           // moves into the demo folder

nano file         // opens (or creates) 'file' using the nano text editor

cat file          // prints the contents of 'file' to the screen

cp file file1     // copies file to a new file named file1

mv file file2     // renames file to file2

rm file2          // deletes file2

clear             // clears the terminal screen

man uname         // shows the manual page for the uname command

uname -a          // displays system information

ifconfig          // shows network settings and IP addresses

ping localhost    // sends test pings of data to your own computer to check connection

netstat           // shows network connections, ports, and routing tables
```
